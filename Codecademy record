It's is also possible to label HTML elements with more than one class.
You learned that elements that share a styling (e.g. typeface) are labeled with the same class. 
When those same elements must also be differentiated, however, labeling with an additional class is helpful.
<h1 class="book domestic">The Way of the Deep</h1>

<h1 class="book foreign">A Night in the Sky</h1>
.book {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
}

.domestic {
  font-color: #0902CC;
}

.foreign {
  font-color: #B097DD;
}
//end
