Browsers read CSS from top to bottom.That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.
It doesn't matter whether you declare this css above or below pink-text class, since id attribute will always take precedence. 
In-line styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.      //end

In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. 
Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full width of its containing element, 
like the <body>, for example. It's not possible, therefore, to center an element that takes up the full width of the page.
div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: auto;
}
When margin: auto is used, an element will center relative to its container. 
For example, the div in the example above was centered relative to the width of the body. 
If the div was contained in larger div, the smaller div would center relative to the width of the larger div. 
This is important to keep in mind when attempting to center nested elements, like divs.           //end
