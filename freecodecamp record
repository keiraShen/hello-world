Browsers read CSS from top to bottom.That means that, in the event of a conflict, the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.
It doesn't matter whether you declare this css above or below pink-text class, since id attribute will always take precedence. 
In-line styles will override all the CSS declarations in your style element.//end

In order to center an element, a width must be set for that element. 
Otherwise, the width of the div will be automatically set to the full width of its containing element, 
like the <body>, for example. It's not possible, therefore, to center an element that takes up the full width of the page.
div.headline {
  width: 400px;
  margin: auto;
}
